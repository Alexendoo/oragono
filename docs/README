Oragono is a modern, experimental IRC server written in Go. It's designed to be simple to setup
and use, and to provide the majority of features that IRC users expect today.

It includes features such as UTF-8 nicks and channel names, client accounts and SASL, and other
assorted IRCv3 support.

                                      http://oragono.io/

=== Installing ===

Copy the example config file to ircd.yaml with a command like:

    $ cp oragono.yaml ircd.yaml

Modify the config file as you like.

Run these commands in order -- these will setup each section of the server:

    $ oragono initdb
    $ oragono mkcerts
    $ oragono run

And you should now be running Oragono!
