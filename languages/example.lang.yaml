# name - this is the 'nice' or 'full' name of the language
name: "Example"

# code - this is what the language will be referred to in our list of languages
code: "example"

# maintainers - these are the maintainer details given

# strings - this holds the actual replacements
# make sure this is the last part of the file, and that the below string, "strings:", stays as-is
# the language-update processor uses the next line to designate which part of the file to ignore and
# which part to actually process.
