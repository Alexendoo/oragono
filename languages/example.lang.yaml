# name - this is the 'nice' or 'full' name of the language
name: "Example"

# code - this is what the language will be referred to in our list of languages
code: "example"

# maintainers - these are the maintainer details given
maintainers: "Daniel Oaks <daniel@danieloaks.net>"

# incomplete - whether to mark this language as incomplete
incomplete: true

# translations - this holds the actual replacements
# make sure this is the last part of the file, and that the below string, "translations:",
# stays as-is. the language-update processor uses the next line to designate which part of
# the file to ignore and which part to actually process.
